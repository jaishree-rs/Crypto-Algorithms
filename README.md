# Crypto-Algorithms 

This project implements a collection of cipher algorithms in C, providing functionalities for both encryption and decryption of text.

### File
- `algorithms.c` – Full source code containing all the algorithms and a menu-based system for selection.

### Included Algorithms
1. Caesar Cipher  
2. Atbash Cipher  
3. August Cipher  
4. Affine Cipher  
5. Vigenère Cipher  
6. Gronsfeld Cipher  
7. Beaufort Cipher  
8. Autokey Cipher  
9. Running Key Cipher  
10. Hill Cipher  
11. Rail Fence Cipher
12. N-Gram Operations
13. Route Cipher  
14. Myszkowiski Cipher

### How to Run
1. Compile the code:  
   ```bash
   gcc algorithms.c -o crypto
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./crypto
  ```
3. Use the menu to choose a cipher and perform encryption or decryption.
